# About the project

This is my version of code of popular and old game. This game was developed in Python using the library of pygame to handle a gui, the timing and the events. 

This project does not explore pygame in depth, is developed using a basic concepts of this library. 

Of course, there are still many things to improve, feel free to send suggestions.
